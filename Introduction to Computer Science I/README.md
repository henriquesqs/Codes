# Introduction to Computer Science I 
Here you can check my first projects at university. Here's a resume of each one of them:

### **[Balanceamento de Recursos (resources balancing)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20I/BalanceamentoRecursos.c)**
Given a matrix that represents a game map, the goal of this project is to **check if some player has advantage above other**. It's said that a player X has advantage above other player Y if there's some resources that are closer to player X than to player Y.

### **[Colisão entre Objetos (collision between objects)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20I/ColisaoEntreObjetos.c)**
This project was developed within **Analytical Geometry subject**. With the help of Gaussian Elimination, this program **checks if there is a collision between this objects in space**:
- two planes; 
- a line and a plane; and 
- two lines.

### **[Sistema de Recomendação (Recommendation system)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20I/SistemaRecomendacao.c)**
This program shows movie recommendations based on users with the same preference as you. It attempts to correctly show you your coming score for a movie if there's enough data for it.
