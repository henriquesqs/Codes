# Assembly MIPS Calculator
This is our simple calculator created using assembly mips trough MARS IDE. 

### Language and Tools
- Assembly MIPS;
- MARS MIPS Simulator;
  
### Introduction
Our calculator provides you the following math operations:

 - **Sum**: sum of two input numbers;
 - **Subtraction**: subctration of two input numbers;
 - **Multiplication**: multiplication of two input numbers;
 - **Multiplication table**: it shows you the mult. table of input number;
 - **Division**: division of two input numbers;
 - **Power**: raise a number to the power of other;
 - **Square root**: calcultes square root of a number.
 
Besides this math operations, it was asked to us to develop a calculator  that can do other operations:
 - **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: given your weight and height, it shows you your BMI;
 - **Fibonnaci**: it shows the fibonacci sequence for the first X (your input) numbers;
 - **Factorial**: calculates factorial of a number (your input).
### How to use
First of all, you need to [**download**](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm) and **install MARS** or other IDE that can compile and execute assembly MIPS. After executing the compiled code, you'll se the application menu:

Choose between one of this options. In this example, we'll choose **sum operation**. So, we must **enter 1 and the two numbers that we want to sum**. For this example, we choose numbers 5 and 3 so, the result must be 8. The application will show us the result and ask if we want to do an other operation before:

**OBS**: Some input examples can be found [here](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Organization%20and%20Architecture%20of%20Computer/Calculadora/casosTeste.txt) but everything is in brazilian portuguese.

Hope you'll enjoy! :)
