# Path Finding
Given a initial position (x,y), this program tries to find the correct path to a target position using five search algorithms:

- Depth-First Search (DFS);
- Breadth-First Search (BFS);
- Best-First Search;
- Hill Climbing;
- A* (A Star).

This program shows the spent time and the path made by each search algorithm until it finds the target position. The path made is like shown:

## Requirements
- Python;
- Matplotlib;
- Numpy.

## Instructions
Execute by entering `python buscas_ia.py`. 

This will run the path finding for all **'Labirinto#.txt'** files, where # is a number from 1 to 'numLabirintos', a variable that must be set inside the file.

For further information, check the [documentation](#) (in Portuguese).
