# OpenGL basic primitives 
Just a folder with some basic exercises using OpenGL primitives (triangles, circles, etc) to create something.

- Running [`spaceship.py`](https://github.com/henriquesqs/University/blob/master/Computer%20Graphics/OpenGL%20basic%20primitives/spaceship.py) will create a 720x600 window with a moving "spaceship" and a background changing its color from black to blue. Also, you'll see the space with clouds (??????)
