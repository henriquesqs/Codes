# First project
This project illustrates a scene with a bird, a man and other objects composed by the basic primitives (triangles, squares, circles etc). With this project you can:

- Translate the man and the bird;
- Rotate and switch the scene from day to night;

## Getting started
First you need to install **[python3](https://www.python.org/)**. After that, install **glfw**, **numpy**, **ipykernel** and **PyOpenGL** using:

```pip install glfw numpy PyOpenGL```

Then run the project by using:

```python3 project.py```

## Controls
- To **translate the man**, use **W, A, S and D** keys *(don't forget to appreciate the 'depth effect' when you move the man using the S key)*;
- To **translate the bird**, use **arrow keys**;
- To **rotate and change from day to night** (or vice versa), use the KEYBOARD numbers 1 and 2 **(not the numpad ones)**

## Notes
- There is a vertical limit so you can't translate the man and the bird to the sky.
