# OpenGL basic primitives 
Just a folder with some basic exercises using OpenGL primitives (triangles, circles, etc) to create something.

- Running `spaceship.py` will create a 720x600 window with a moving "spaceship" and a background with color change from black to blue. Also you'll see a sky with clouds (?)
