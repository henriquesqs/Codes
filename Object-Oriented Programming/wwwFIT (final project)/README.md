This project was designed and developed with the help of my teammates. The idea is to give users the opportunity to do some physical exercises at their homes.

 ### Development
The backend was developed using **Java** and [**Spring framework**](https://spring.io/) with its dependencies. The frontend was developed with **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript** functions.

###### For portuguese speakers: click [**here**](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Object-Oriented%20Programming/wwwFIT%20%28final%20project%29/Especifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20-%20POO.pdf) to access the full specification.

### Using the application

To initialize the web application in a fast way, install and execute **[xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html)**. After the installation, configure the MySQL database and apache server.

If everything went ok, you'll be able to access the application in your localhost. Let's take a look:

Here's the index:

As you can see, you can click and learn **how to use our application** in  '***ajuda***' (help) section, **see more about the development group** in section '***sobre***' (about) and you can **register your user** in '***cadastre-se***' (register) section.

To register, you need to give some information. We don't do any validation of your data :)

After registering, the user needs to login and select between the three available kinds of training exercises: (from left to right) **stretching**, **cardio** and **strength**.

Suppose that you want to select stretching exercises. Click on "***iniciar treino***" (start training). Now you'll se what kind of intensity is available for this physical exercises training set. On this case, you can choose between ***curto*** (short) and ***longo*** (long) exercises.

Now imagine that you selected short exercises by clicking on "***iniciar***" (start). Here's what you'll be able to see:

![initial instructions of stretching exercises](https://i.imgur.com/vK4PBuM.png)

On this page and the next exercises pages, you'll see a picture on the left site of the page describing what position you'll need to do with your body, the instructions of the exercise in the middle box and options for this exercise (such as **go to the next exercise**, **leave exercise** and **go back to the training set**) in the right box. Our idea was to introduce a video  (*Video demonstrativo* tab) helping the user to do the exercise but we went out of time to do so and never tried again (that's a bad example of ours!). 

After completing all the exercises, you'll get to the final page and you'll se a green box with "***finalizar exerc√≠cio***" (finalize exercise) written on it. After clicking on it, you'll be redirect to the index page and you'll be able to see your progress:

That's our application! Hope you've enjoyed. :)
