# Introduction to Computer Science II 
Here you can check my first projects at college. Here's a resume of each one of them:

### **[Calculadora de Expressões Aritméticas (Arithmetic expressions calculator)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20II/CalculadoraExpressoesAritmeticas)**
Given a binary arithmetic expression, this calculator uses the [**Shunting Yard Algorithm**](https://brilliant.org/wiki/shunting-yard-algorithm/) to calculate its value. It does so by parsing the expression. It was done using stack and a binary tree.

### **[Gerenciador de Abas de Navegador (Navigator's tab manager)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20II/GerenciadorAbasNavegador)**
This program **simulates the navigator's tab manager** by using a double linked list. It was my first time using this Data Structure.

### **[Classificação de Plantas (Plants classification)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20II/ClassificacaoEspeciesDePlantasKNN.c)**
Given a training set and a test set, this program **implements the K-NN Algorithm using Euclidean Distance to classify a flower** and insertion sort.

###### The fun fact is that this was done in 2018 and in January 2020 I was asked to develop the K-NN again, but using python (and it was so much easier...)

### **[Corretor Automático (Automatic corrector)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20II/CorretorAutomatico.c)**
Given a file with some words (simulation of a dictionary), **this program checks if a file** (in this project we openned tweet files) **contains incorrect words** (words that were not found in the dictionary). It was done using Binary Search and Merge Sort.
 
### **[Recuperação de Imagens (Images recovery)](https://github.com/henriquesqs/Graduation-codes/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science%20II/RecuperacaoImagens.c)**
Given a corrupted file, this program seeks and recover the images in this file and output them to the folder. It does do by searching for the header of the images.
